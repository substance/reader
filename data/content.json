Users should be able to focus on their writing, leaving the layout part to the system entirely. The content produced should be exposed as data, which would allow digital digital documents to be queried like a database. The project was rather small at the beginning. It was fun to experiment with web-based editing and try pushing it to the boundaries. With the help of Samo Korosec, I got a first release ready around February 2011. The initial feedback was great. More than 5000 people signed up within the first three months. They wanted more. I wanted more. But Substance wasn't ready for production use. I was aware of that and tried hard to make it solid. And I failed, many times. While the idea is so simple, it turned out the execution is incredibly hard."

We are still on our mission to build open software to modernize digital publishing and move beyond simulating paper, as this is what current word-processors (MS Word, OpenOffice) and formats (PDF) do. By promoting an open document format and supporting tools we want to unleash the full power of digital content and provide an interactive experience for authoring and viewing. Moreover, we would like to enable people to be their own publisher and no longer be subject to the politics of big publishing companies and software vendors. In order to accomplish that, we need to ensure we can self-finance our Open Source efforts. In this post I'd like to explain some decisions we have made in order to make that happen and how we plan to move on. But first, let me explain what the main idea of Substance was about."

Once we are out of beta, the app will be available at a low price. With your purchase of the app, you'll be supporting the Substance ecosystem which will remain completely Open Source. Note, that the Composer is just our own reference implementation of an editor built on top of the Substance document model. We are looking forward to see the community build other editor variants for different use-cases."
